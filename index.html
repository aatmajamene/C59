        <p class="para">My hobby is reading interesting books in my free time. Whenever I get home from my school I like to read such books. I am 11 years old and am in 5th grade. Now I know very well that reading is very good habit which can make me a better person. This hobby can be developed by anyone however I got this naturally. Reading books can always keep one happy and busy. It is the good source of enjoyment, knowledge, inspiration and instruction that makes reading so special! It makes us disciplined, loyal, punctual and most importantly a successful person in life.
